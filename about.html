            <p>
                Alex began his academic journey at UW-Stout before transferring to UW-Madison in the fall of 2024. His time at UW-Stout was filled with exciting experiences, 
                from meeting new friends and making connections to navigating the sprawling campus. The move to UW-Madison has been equally exhilarating, 
                offering new opportunities and a vibrant community.
            </p>

                During his stint at UW-Stout, Alex discovered his passion for rock climbing. 
                He served as a Lead Student Manager at the climbing gym, which not only sharpened his 
                skills but also led to many memorable climbing adventures. In fact, some of his best 
                stories come from hanging off various rock faces and dodging falling rocks!
            </p>

                Speaking of memorable experiences, Alex has developed a profound love for Red Bull
                 since starting college. If you spot him with a can in hand, it's either a sign of 
                 late-night study sessions or just his way of staying energized for yet another coding marathon.

                At home, Alex is the proud owner of Ellie, an incredibly lovable golden retriever. 
                Ellie is more than just a pet; she's a faithful companion and an enthusiastic co-pilot 
                during long study sessions. Whether it's playing fetch or giving the best snuggles, Ellie never fails to brighten Alex's day.
